Q.1 What is Docker?
Ans: Docker is basically a platform on which any app can be converted into image and can be run in form of containers, which consists of application source code and 
     OS libraries so that it could run in any environment.
     There is a image sharing platform ie. Docker Hub, in which we can upload our image in public or private repository and we can also download any image available in docker hub 
     and can add that image to uor app.

Q.2 Why is docker?
Ans: Earlier, if any company's any app is developed by the developer team using there system and machines and then after developing they take the whole code to the Production team
     for deployment of app and the Production team could have differ configuration and differ versions so, there could be some some error so to remove this conflict, docker comes into
     play where the image can be build and can be uploaded to the Docker Hub(Basically, a repository to share app) by the developer team and later, it can be downloaded by the Prod team
     with no versions issue and compatibility issues.
