Docker Important commands:
4. WHatever happening in docker it is happening in container.

5. (-it command): it is also used to go inside a container.

lets pull image of mongodb, to check mongo is installed in system or not, type mongo
- move to dockerhub.com and download the mongo image

docker ps --all : for checking any container is running or not
docker pull image_name : to download the image in docker

6. For mongodb:
	docker start containerID : to start the container

	docker exec -it containerID : to go inside and it gives us the bash shell of mongo
	>show dbs : in the mongodb bash or sh
	-to exit from the bash: ctrl+d
	-to from the container: ctrl+d

	docker stop containerID: to stop the running container

7. Exec Command:
	when we write exec -it command then it say that change the stdin and stdout 
	(-i: keep the stdin open even if not attached)
	(-t: allocate a pseudo tty)
	
8. How to go into container in multiple way: 
	i). docker exec -it containerID
	ii). docker run -it image bash : not recommended
	iii). touch fileName.txt : to create a file in mongo
	
9. To create a docker image there should be a Dockerfile(in which commands are written)
   and then this file is sended to docker client and it will generate a custom image.
	Dockerfile-> FROM alpine
		     RUN apk add binutils	
		     RUN apk add someprogram

	-docker build .

10. to give name to the container:
	docker build -t username/anyname:tag .	// . is importanr at last
	docker run username/anyname
